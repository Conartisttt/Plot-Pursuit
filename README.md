## Description 

Introducing Plot Persuit, the ultimate tool for book enthusiasts to manage their 'To Be Read' (TBR) lists with ease! Plot Persuit is a comprehensive application designed to empower users in curating and organizing their personal libraries. With Plot Persuit, users can create a digital library of their unread books, allowing them to efficiently track which books they have yet to read.

One of the standout features of Plot Persuit is its ability to update the status of books as 'read' once the user has finished reading them. This feature not only helps users keep track of their reading accomplishments but also ensures that their library remains up to date.

Whether you're an avid reader looking to organize your extensive book collection or a casual reader aiming to stay on top of your reading list, Plot Persuit is the perfect companion for bibliophiles of all kinds. Say goodbye to scattered TBR lists and hello to a streamlined reading experience with Plot Persuit!
